The theory of unification of all things in the White Hole system universe
Basic principle explanation
I believe that the center of the universe is a white hole, and matter is ejected from the white hole. The white hole is located beneath the black hole, and all we can see is a very small space in the white hole system. In the white hole system, star systems hover and fly towards singularities at superluminal speeds. The white hole system has two outward expanding cantilevers, and the perception space inside the white hole system is different from the hypothetical observation outside the black hole. The perception inside the white hole system is that the white hole has an outward expanding cantilever at the center, while the hypothetical observation outside the black hole has an inward contracting cantilever at the center of the singularity
A material in a white cave system is composed of basic pure waves that can exist stably. Pure waves have super flexibility, also known as super soft waves. Pure waves can have spherical and non spherical vibrations, which provide wave pressure. Wave pressure exists on the wave crest, and the frequency will affect the width of the wave crest. Two types of conjugate spherical pure waves with the same frequency generate two types of spherical wave eaves, which correspond to two electrical characteristics. The spherical wave eaves attract or repel under wave pressure. The conjugate pure wave eaves formed by non spherical vibrations and the same frequency conjugate pure wave vibrations also have an attractive effect. The wave pressure provided by the conjugate pure wave eaves attracts and extinguishes each other, such as in the case of positive and negative matter. Pure waves that cannot be extinguished should also have a repulsive force with spherical pure waves. However, under external wave pressures such as singular point wave pressures, they exhibit attraction, similar to the principle of combining atomic nuclei with electric particles. Pure waves combine at equal pressure or are in equilibrium with wave pressure during motion. The frequency of pure waves determines the width of the wave eaves, which is the range of influence, including complex planets. Higher frequencies have wider wave eaves, and the motion laws of pure waves can constitute physical, chemical, and spatial structural properties. The different methods of composite structures and wave eaves and pressure form different strengths of binding forces, such as atomic nuclear force and gravity. The basic pure wave originates from the extinction of a pure wave outside the black hole. As long as the energy on both sides is equal, it can be exchanged into the interior of the black hole. The internal and external pure waves of the black hole may not be exactly the same, that is, the physical basis composition is different. Which basic pure waves should be related to the singularity frequency and external basic pure waves Pure waves or spherical pure waves can be combined into composite particles at equal wave pressure or equilibrium position of motion pressure, and can be used to form a layer of particles based on this principle The pure wave energy of cyclic recombination can form quark like confined composite particles When the wave pressure outside a certain space shows a pressure of 0, it is a neutral particle. Breaking through a certain space, the neutral particle recombines, just like a chemical reaction between a molecule and other molecules is the recombination of neutral particles.
  
Theoretical speculations that can be used for verification
Decay should be caused by the frequency of composite particles being easily disrupted by environmental frequencies. Superconductivity essentially constructs an almost perfect isobaric wave tube. The radius of a black hole should also differ from the radius of a black hole in relativity, because the equations in relativity are not recursively nested and do not take into account the influence of wave pressure at the singularity of the white hole system. Antimatter and normal matter should have attraction and cannot be calculated using the universal gravity formula, as weak gravity may be difficult to measure. The asteroid belt should be the center zone of equivalent anti wave pressure, and the gravity in this area may not be smooth, which can be detected by atomic clocks. The division of the solar system into inner and outer sides by the asteroid belt is essentially the same as the division of black holes into inner and outer sides, and should be related to the confrontation of space mass. The reason for the redshift is that the one behind our galaxy on the white hole cantilever is receding due to our faster acceleration, while the one in front is accelerating away from us. The one on the same plane is spreading out, indicating that the white hole cantilever should be thicker as it moves outward. The arrangement law of atomic electron layers is essentially arranged according to the equivalent law of wave pressure recombination The arrangement pattern of planetary positions has a formula, and the formula represents a pattern that is related to the equivalent wave pressure. Planets are located in the same plane, which is caused by the long-term interaction and equilibrium of cylindrical wave pressure generated by faster stellar flight and planetary revolution.

Explain some known physical phenomena using this theory
The reason why the Milky Way does not collapse due to its high-speed rotation is because the singularity is suppressed by strong wave pressure. In general, when a substance is heated, the pure wave eaves widen and the substance expands. Quantum erasure selection experiment explanation shows that when particles and ultra soft waves are touched on either side of the detector, the other end is determined, and vice versa, When particles and ultra soft waves are detected on either side of the detector, the other end is determined, and when waves are detected, the opposite is true The essence of tunneling quantum entanglement is due to the super flexibility of pure waves.
